 * If table output vastly overextends the terminal width, we should use multi-line output to keep the table informative
   - or, allow a horizontal scrolling pager

 * Hide passwords in process listing
 * Parse .my.cnf and support options there-in
   - prompt = \\u@\\h[\\R:\\m:\\s]>
   - safe-updates
   - select_limit
   - skip-auto-rehash
   - database
   - host
   - user
   - password
